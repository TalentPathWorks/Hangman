# Hangman
A simple JavaScript console application.

## Getting Started

On console run the following command`npm install` in the Hangman directory to begin installing dependencies then running `npm start`to start the game. The game will choose randomly from a word bank and display an empty representation of that word  and how many letters it has. 

### Rules

* You have at least 5 tries to guess the word before you lose

### Features

* **Guessing words**
